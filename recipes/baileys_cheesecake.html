        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with rack in lower third position. Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan with cooking spray and line with parchment on the bottom.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly while making the filling, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Once crust is cooled, wrap bottom of pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping into pan.</p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>To make the cheesecake filling: Add cream cheese to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream, and beat on medium-low speed until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, about 2 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Beat in sugar, espresso powder, vanilla, and salt, until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through, about 1 minute. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until combined after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

        <p>Pour filling onto cooled crust. Place spring form pan into a larger roasting pan and place in preheated oven. Pour 1 1/2 cups of water in roasting pan and bake until the cheesecake is almost set (the center 2 inches should jiggle slightly) and edges have pulled away slightly from pan, 50 to 60 minutes.</p>
